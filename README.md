# Project Title

A personal research assistant 

## Summary

This AI-powered personal research assistant helps researchers manage their workload by curating relevant academic papers and aggregating news while also assisting with personal tasks like reminders, shopping lists, and workout plans. Using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and recommendation algorithms, it filters information from platforms like *Google Scholar* and *The New York Times* to provide tailored insights. Designed to reduce mental burden without over-automating, this tool could also be adapted for other professions.

## Background

Researchers have a heavy workload and sometimes have to sacrifice their health, personal life, or family time. Our research assistant would help organize their daily tasks by removing the mental burden of managing these responsibilities without AI.

## How is it used?

Researchers could use this tool, provided it is well encrypted, to reduce their workload and mental burden. On an interface available on their computer or smartphone.


## Data sources and AI methods

The interface could be divided into two main parts. On one side, it would integrate a scientific database tailored to the researcher’s field, capable of selecting relevant new papers from various platforms, including both scientific sources and general press articles. 
The AI would be able to navigate different websites and understand the key issues in the research domain.
Scientific databases: The AI would analyze platforms like Google Scholar, PubMed, and ArXiv to identify the most relevant articles based on the user’s research field.
General and specialized press: RSS feeds and news APIs (such as those from The New York Times, Le Monde, or L’Express) would allow for aggregating information on current trends and debates.

On the other side, the assistant would be capable of generating shopping lists, workout programs, and daily reminders (such as vaccinations, health prevention, activity registrations, or personal meetings), based on the preferences, the schedule and needs provided by the user.
User’s personal data: Based on the user’s stated preferences, the AI could organize daily tasks, generate reminders, or suggest personalized recommendations.

## Challenges

It is important to avoid full automation to preserve the critical thinking essential to research work and not to overlook the spontaneity crucial to personal life.

## What next?

This system could be adapted to other professions based on specific needs. For instance, a nurse could be informed about significant advancements in healthcare practices or current risks (such as rising depression rates or epidemic threats) and gain access to high-quality sources.
